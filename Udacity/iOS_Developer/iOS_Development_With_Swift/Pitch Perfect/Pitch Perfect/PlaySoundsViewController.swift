        Stack Views:
        In this view controller we'll use Stack Views. These
        allows us to put several elements inside of them, and
        it will automatically apply Auto Layout inside. We can
        then create one big Vertical Stack View, inside of it
        put three Horizontal Stack Views, and inside of each
        put two buttons, creating a 3x2 grid of buttons.

        1. Drag a Vertical Stack View to the view in storyboard.
        2. Drag an arrow from it to its parent view.
        3. Select:
            * Leading Space To Safe Area
            * Top Space To Safe Area
            * Trailing Space To Safe Area
            * Bottom Space To Safe Area
        4. Once the 4 constrains are added, in the attributes
           inspector set the constant of each to 0, so that the
           Vertical Stack View takes the whole space of the view.
        5. Make sure the Vertical Stack View has the properties
           "Alignment" as "Fill", "Distribution" as "Fill Equally"
           with the "Spacing" property set to 0.
        6. Drag an Horizontal Stack View inside of the Vertical
           Stack View and set the same properties as step 5.
